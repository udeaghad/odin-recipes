            DESCRIPTION
        </h2>
        <p>
            Just like  <strong>Jollof Rice</strong> we savor these meals so much, and we can barely do without them in gatherings and festive seasons, and it’s a meal you can make in no time. Such a simple recipe, but the impact it makes in a gathering is quite remarkable!
        </p>
        <p>
            This fried rice is entirely different from the popular Asian Chicken Fried Rice because the depth of the taste in the later comes from the Soy sauce while the depth of taste of the later comes from the Curry powder, Thyme, Seasoning cubes, and of course the abundance of vegetables like Carrots, Green beans, Peas, sweet corn, and Onions.

            Steps
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>This recipe starts with already parboiled rice, so it makes the whole process easier. If you don’t have already parboiled rice, you can see how to do that here. It’s also okay to use a day old rice that has been refrigerated it is very convenient, and the result is just as good.</li>
            <li>I also cooked this parboiled rice in a bit of well-seasoned stock so that the Rice can absorb more flavor. Though it’s advisable to this, however, this step can be skipped if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Add the parboiled Rice to the stock and cook until the water is dried up.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oil in a pan, throw in the onions and fry for a minute or two, add the scallions, mixed vegetables, thyme, curry powder, salt, and stock Cube.</li>
            <li>Throw in the beef liver and rice. Stir-fry for about 3 to 5 Minutes. Take it off the heat and serve.</li>
